# Samples-Website
> This is a webpage I designed for myself to help me with coding. I built it to give me quick go-to references on how to code certain tasks. I completely designed and built the website from the server to the front-end. The server is run with Ubuntu. I built a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) on it which runs my website. The website is dynamically buit with PHP. HTML and CSS form the design, and JavaScript helps with the functionality. My coding reference base is stored in MySQL and organized according to type.
